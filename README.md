# Blockchain ID
Using EIP 820 for ID claims

## Overview
Everytime an exchange calls an ID provider to KYC documents, they incure an expense.  Futhermore, users are required every time provide KYC information, instead of a portable verification.

## Process

A user makes a claim that is substantiated with with some supporting evidence, such as a government issued document, utilities bill or such.

1. Submit your claim with supporting documentation to a trusted provider with an ETH public key
2. Add documents to the contract as a claim
3. Authenticate with compatible services

### Claims based ID

List of claims

| Key | Subject | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x0000 | Full Name | Clients Full Name |  |
| 0x0001 | Birth Year | YYYY | ISO 8601 |
| 0x0002 | Date of Birth | YYYY-MM-DD | ISO 8601 |


## Trusted ID verification providers

A smart contract contains a stuct of trusted providers.  The providers can only be granted or revoked by an independent third party, such as Blockchain Australia.

1812 Example

```
stuct Claim {
	bytes2 key
}

struct ID {
	address issuer;
	address subject;
	uint256 validFrom;
	uint256 validTo;
}
```

Issuer: The ID provider.  This could be Blockchain Australia
Subject:  See table


| Key | Document | Details
| --- | --- | ---
| 0x00 | Australian birth certificate | A full birth certificate in your name or former name issued by Births, Deaths and Marriages. We canâ€™t accept birth extracts or birth cards.
| 0x01 | Australian driver licence | A current driver licence with your photo issued in your name. This includes physical and digital driver licences, current learner permits and provisional licences. 


780 Example
```
contract EthereumClaimsRegistry {

    mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bytes32))) public registry;

    event ClaimSet(
        address indexed issuer,
        address indexed subject,
        bytes32 indexed key,
        bytes32 value,
        uint updatedAt);

    event ClaimRemoved(
        address indexed issuer,
        address indexed subject,
        bytes32 indexed key,
        uint removedAt);

    // create or update claims
    function setClaim(address subject, bytes32 key, bytes32 value) public {
        registry[msg.sender][subject][key] = value;
        emit ClaimSet(msg.sender, subject, key, value, now);
    }

    function setSelfClaim(bytes32 key, bytes32 value) public {
        setClaim(msg.sender, key, value);
    }

    function getClaim(address issuer, address subject, bytes32 key) public view returns(bytes32) {
        return registry[issuer][subject][key];
    }

    function removeClaim(address issuer, address subject, bytes32 key) public {
        require(msg.sender == issuer);
        delete registry[issuer][subject][key];
        emit ClaimRemoved(msg.sender, subject, key, now);
    }
}
```

# Verfication
Once the user has verified their identity, a third party service such as a crypto exchange may want to verifiy their users identity.  Put simply, "is this person who they say they are?"
